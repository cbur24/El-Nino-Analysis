# El-Nino-Analysis
Scripts for a tropical forest carbon cycle model. Global Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) site data is used to derived empirical equations of the primary components of net primary productivity as a function of climate anomalies.  Reanlaysis data is then used to scale data to the pantropics.
ERAI_scale_up :  Calculates Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) across the pantropics using a general linear model and ERA-Interim climate data
MERRA_TRMM_stan_glm : Calculates NEE using a Bayesian GLM and MERRA2 and TRMMM climate data
